# Pokemon Trading Application

The Pokemon Trading Application will be a full-stack web page with the ability for users to join and be able to trade pokemon amongst each other. We will be using the PokeAPI to get data instead of creating a table of hundreds of pokemon in our dBeaver. Our users will be able to create a new account with a username and password. 

Technologies Being used
1) Angular
2) Hibernate
3) AWS
4) Spring


EACH PROJECT MUST HAVE 6 CORE FUNCTIONALITIES (login can be one)

Optional Requirements---------------------------------------------

1. Use the Spring framework to (hopefully) make your development lives easier
2. Run your application on an EC2 (which we’ll talk about on Wednesday or Thursday)
3. Get and use data from an external API in order to add more interesting data/functionality to your application 
4. For instance using the pokeapi to get pokemon objects 
5. But there are SO MANY apis you can find, my P2 team used a fake shopping api to get images for ecommerce site
I’m not saying replace Java with an external api, but use Java to get some data from an external api. 
DON’T REPLACE YOUR DATABASE WITH THIS
